prepProces: A+A don't need to go in singleIn..
unless A+A'B==  this kind of input need to expand. One pattern of this to check the length of the input if input length 3 or === 3... then go directly to parser and as Final.
Any input that greater than 3 directly go to Executioner to process in red flag..

Especial Case were Input are ()().. () need to Go to Parser RHS or to further check this include Distributive, Absorbtion,De Morgan and double Negation and more.

In the  Executioner under Checking Case;

if input length=3 then proceed to parser..

if not continue to process the uncommon and common until the output length === 3
Any chance that their are some input that not meet let's just see what I can do.
